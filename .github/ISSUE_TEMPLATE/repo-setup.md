Hi @__________! Welcome to your private GitHub repo for your DataCamp Project tentatively titled "______________." You will notice a `develop` branch exists -- this is where you will be developing the Project until it is ready for release. Please do not make changes to the `master` branch.

## Repo structure

The relevant files/folders in the Project repo are:

- `project.ipynb`: The file that will hold the final Project. The format of this notebook is described [here](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/projects/datacamp-projects-jupyter-notebook).
- `project.yml`: The metadata for your Project, for example, the Project title, Project description, etc.
- `img/`: The folder where images go.
- `datasets/`: The folder where datasets go.
- `README.md`: This contains links to the Project dashboard, your Asana to-do list, and your forked application repo. The Project dashboard is where you can preview the Project on datacamp.com ([screenshare](https://www.useloom.com/share/8a3321cb176f4a75aa7ff07cb87f43cd)) and also has content guideline warnings (line limits, character counts, etc. but _currently the character count warnings don't work so ignore those_) that will appear after you push your content to GitHub. Your Asana to-do list contains everything you need to do to launch this Project.
- `requirements.R`: The file where you install the packages you need for your analysis. If this file isn't completed, you will run into errors when you run the code in your Project on datacamp.com. These errors will also be reported in your Project dashboard.

## What I have done so far

I have set up various parts of this repo:
- Updated `README.md` with links to your Project dashboard and your Asana to-do list.
- Updated `project.yml` with a title.
- Created a GitHub Issue titled "Audition feedback" and provided feedback on your audition there.

## Your next steps

Here are your next steps:

- Accept your email invite to your Asana to-do list.
- Fill out this [instructor intake form](https://goo.gl/forms/FigCsmjYG8JtCB6H3) (title, bio, etc. for your DataCamp instructor profile).
- Read through the _"Welcome to the official authoring notebook for your DataCamp Project!"_ cell in `project.ipynb`.
- Watch this 90-second [video](https://www.useloom.com/share/a3e3b56dcd654be4b9dce0b43ac08b2a), starring yours truly.
- Schedule a meet and greet where we can go over any early questions you have. Use [this link](https://davidventuri.youcanbook.me/) to book a time.
- Read the "DataCamp Communication Strategy" GitHub issue.
- Review the "Audition feedback" GitHub Issue.
- Install the packages you need for your analysis in `requirements.R`. If you have any questions or run into any issues, ping me in this GitHub Issue.
- Complete the `@context` and `@solution` code cells for all tasks in your Project.

Also, I've added you to our Enterprise group for instructors, which means you will have Premium DataCamp access as long as you have at least one Project or course live or in development on DataCamp. You should receive an email with an invite.

In your Asana to-do list, I've assigned you all of the tasks to be completed for now. Note that Asana automatically notifies me of my next task when you finish yours. 

If you're comfortable, please try to keep track of the time you invest in creating this Project. I've found [Toggl](http://toggl.com) (a free time-tracking tool) useful. Benefits: if we have more concrete data on how long it takes to create a Project, we can make tweaks to the creation process to make it more efficient as well as compensate our instructors more fairly.

Have fun and let me know if you have any questions! :)
